        An art museum is an institute for visual culture. It collects, manages,
        displays and examines works of art as signs of the time from which they
        originated. The museum believes that artists – both past and present –
        do not merely depict reality but also depict it differently. Artists
        make images and develop ideas to get a grip on reality or to manipulate
        it, whatever suits them best.
